# Cost Optimization for Protein Discovery Lab

This document outlines strategies for optimizing costs when running the protein discovery lab infrastructure.

## Ray Cluster Cost Management

### Scaling Limitations

Ray requires at least one head node to be running at all times to maintain cluster state. True "scale to zero" is not natively supported by Ray without additional custom implementations.

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Worker Node Auto-Scaling**
   - Worker nodes can be configured to scale up and down based on workload
   - Set appropriate `min_workers` and `max_workers` in Ray cluster configuration
   - Configure scale-down idle timeout to release resources promptly

2. **Scheduled Operations**
   - Use AWS EventBridge to schedule cluster shutdown during non-business hours
   - Re-initialize the cluster when needed using automation

3. **Head Node Sizing**
   - Use a smaller instance type for the head node during development phases
   - The head node doesn't necessarily need GPU capabilities unless directly used for computation

4. **Spot Instances for Workers**
   - Configure worker nodes to use spot instances for cost reduction
   - Note: This may introduce some reliability challenges for long-running tasks

## SageMaker Studio Cost Management

1. **Lifecycle Configurations**
   - Use lifecycle configurations to automatically shut down idle kernels
   - Set auto-shutdown policies for notebook instances

2. **Resource Cleanup**
   - Regularly delete unused SageMaker apps and endpoints
   - Monitor and clean up unused S3 objects

## Monitoring and Alerting

1. **Budget Alerts**
   - Set up AWS Budget alerts for early notification of cost overruns

2. **Resource Tagging**
   - Ensure all resources are properly tagged to identify cost centers
   - Use tags for detailed cost analysis and chargeback

3. **Cost Explorer**
   - Regularly review Cost Explorer reports to identify optimization opportunities

## Development Workflows

For development workflows, consider using a hybrid approach:
1. Local development using smaller Ray clusters when possible
2. Cloud deployment for large-scale processing only when needed
3. Save model checkpoints and intermediate results to avoid recomputation
